# hello-world
the first repository after more than ten years. i do not know if i can continue coding or when i quit.

Hi I am Jiantao, a person who have dreams when I was young but now I am lost in the reality.

I was moved by a song "you cannot bear me because I am a loser" which has some sense of Shangri-La.

Where I should go? Who I am?

I still stretch for the change - a break in my life. I hope, esp, my wife hopes I am not retired just now.

I still need to work hard, stretch hard, dig out myself and understand the world. God bless me. Where is God?
